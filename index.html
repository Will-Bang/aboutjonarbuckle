    <p>Hi there everyone! My name is <u><strong>John Arbuckle.</strong></u> I am 30 years old and I am a cartoonist that lives in Muncie, Indiana. I am proud owner of a cat name <strong>Garfield</strong> and a dog named <strong>Odie</strong> Garfield is fat, lazy and loves to eat, while Odie is a dog without a brain.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I spend half my time going to the grocery store to buy enough food to feed Garfield. I have to make sure to buy all of Garfield's Favorit foods, or else he'll get grumpy. This includes milk, cheese, bread, ham, chicken wings, potato chips, pasta with mariana sauce, frozen pizzas, and <strong>lots and lots</strong> of lasagna. When I come home, Garfield usually attacks me and tries to eat everyting in the grocery bag before I even have time to put it in the refrigerator. One time he ate everything that I bought in 30 seconds, and I had to go back to the store to buy more food. <em>I was not too happy about that.</em></p>
